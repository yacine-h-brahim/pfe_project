if you want to start writing html and sass, go to the folder you want to start working on, for example teacher,
you type dnaweb in the address bar and then vscode and your browser are gonna open
make sure you are in the folder not in a subfolder(you see both WebRoot and Source folders)

if your browser opens and you don't see any page, that's because the dnaweb engine tries to find the index.html page, and if you don't have it you need to select which page you want in the address bar(the name you gonna enter is gonna match your html file name)

there is a picture that will help you understand that will show you how to open the login.html file in your browser
the picture is in the same folder as this README.txt file
